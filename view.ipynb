      "                             reddit_1o6qmyy I am 27 M. I make $65k pre tax. I have a 700 credit score and I have around $7200 of credit card debt (I know that’s not a lot compared to others that I’ve seen on this sub Reddit) I am just trying to get ahead of the issue before it gets worse\\n\\nI have put some budget metrics below (monthly)\\nRent/utilities - 1400\\nFood -average $467\\nRestaurants-$150\\nDog-$120\\nSubscriptions - $100\\nHockey (league plus drop ins)- $50\\nWants - $200\\nMedical - $475 (includes a $360 monthly payment for dental implant- last payment March 2026)\\nRoth- $100\\n\\nOne thing to keep in mind is use my credit card for 90% of things. I want to accumulate points. I make probably $1200-1400 of credit card payments a month but as you can see from my budget and the previous statement, it seems counterintuitive. \\n\\nI understand that I could cut down on eating out and maybe lower the beer fund for each month but my income is going up steadily (4.5-6% every 6-8 months) \\n\\nI have tried to do a balance transfer card but I guess my debt to balance ratio is not too appealing. I work in banking so I have adopted decent spending practices and made sacrifices to my living situation to help supplement my disposable income. However, as you can see, I have high medical costs. I WANT to get corticosteroid injections for my knees (which would run me $700 after insurance, average cost of a few different places) but my debt and income is making me hesitant. \\n\\nI have never made a post on Reddit but use it often because the community is usually pretty honest with their experiences which I admire. \\n\\nTL;DR: I have $7000 of CC debt and I feel like I need a better system to pay it down reddit     Payments and Cash Out\n",
